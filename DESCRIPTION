Description: This collection of functions is basically a set of tools that I
    have created to help with data analysis involving financial data. Most of these
    are just small annoyances that I have resolved with short functions that speed
    development of larger applications. For example, you might want to create a
    cumulative wealth index from return data on the fly. makeIndex() aids in this
    task. There are many xts helpers like xtsApply(), which is a generic apply
    function for xts objects. Things like making a multi-variable xts object from a
    list of tickers can be handled by tickersToXTS(). In many ways, this package is
    like the hMisc package which I imagine was created to resolve the many issues
    they encountered in data to day R life.
