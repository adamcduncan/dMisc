Most of these are just small annoyances\nthat I have resolved with short functions that speed development of larger applications. For\nexample, you might want to create a cumulative wealth index from return data on the fly.\nmakeIndex() aids in this task. There are many xts helpers like xtsApply(), which is a generic\napply function for xts objects. Things like making a multi-variable xts object from a list of\ntickers can be handled by tickersToXTS(). In many ways, this package is like the hMisc package\nwhich I imagine was created to resolve the many issues they encountered in data to day R life.\nLicense: What license is it under?\nLazyData: TRUE\n",
